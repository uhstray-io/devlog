# AI Disclosure Policy: How we use AI in Development and Writing

## Disclosure Policy for Devlog

We are committed to transparency regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the creation of content for this blog. No articles, outlines, or materials are written or generated by AI. All content is authored by humans.

AI is only used for consultation and review purposes, such as fact-checking, grammar suggestions, or providing feedback. We keep AI usage to a minimum and do not believe that AI-generated content serves any meaningful purpose for teaching or sharing knowledge on this site.

AI tools are only ever supplementary and can not replace the human touch in content creation. It is against the best interest of both the authors and the readers to rely on AI generated content. We believe that human creativity, critical thinking, and expertise are irreplaceable in producing high quality content.

If you have questions about our AI policy or content creation process, feel free to reach out.


## Disclosure Policy for Development 

When it comes to project development, AI tools are in limited use for tasks such as autocomplete suggestions, code review, bug detection, and performance optimization. These tools assist developers in identifying potential issues and improving code quality, but they do not replace the expertise and judgment of human developers.

We do not rely on AI generated code in the form of "Vibe Coding" or "One shot" code generation. But, we may use AI tools to assist in generating code snippets, examples, research, and documentation. These tools are used as aids to enhance productivity and ensure code quality and consistency. 

Our code is OUR code, and we take full responsibility for its quality and integrity.


Thank you for reading and supporting our commitment to transparency in AI usage.
