##### In this post, we will explore the concept of programming language values, why they matter, and how to choose the right programming language based on your values as a developer. We will also how these values impact the development experience and the software we create as well as the pitfalls of ignoring them.



A programming language is more then just a set of keywords and syntax. A language is a set of ideas and values. The language's core values are driven almost entirely by Community and it Core Team members. Therefore, when we are choosing a language, we are really choosing wheithr we want to be apart of that set of values and community. Inheriently, the community will shape the language based on their values. 

Every language has values them wheither they are stated or not. Sometimes these values change over time as the community and core team change. When choosing a language, it is important to understand what those values are and how they align with your own values as a developer. 

Historically, older programming languages were created out of necessity, not values. It was only later that communities formed around these languages and began to shape their values. And that is why choosing the right programming language is so important. When we are choosing a language, we are choosing a set of values that will shape our development experience and the software we create. 

# Value Conflicts & Tradeoffs

Here is a table of some of the Values discussed in his talk:


| | | |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Approachability  | Integrity       | Robustness   |
| Availability     | Maintainability | Safety       |
| Compatibility    | Measurability   | Security     |
| Composability    | Operability     | Simplicity   |
| Debuggability    | Performance     | Stability    |
| Expressiveness   | Portability     | Thoroughness |
| Extensibility    | Resilience      | Transparency |
| Interoperability | Rigor           | Velocity     |


And here are some of the values associated with popular programming languages. This list is not exhaustive, but it gives a good idea of how different languages prioritize different values.

|Language  | Values |
|----------|--------|
|C         | Performance, Portability, Simplicity |
|C++       | Performance, Expressiveness, Compatibility |
|Elm       | Safety, Maintainability, Simplicity |
|Elixir    | Scalability, Maintainability, Resilience |
|Go        | Simplicity, Performance, Maintainability |
|Java      | Portability, Maintainability, Compatibility |
|Python    | Approachability, Expressiveness, Extensibility |
|Rust      | Safety, Performance, Robustness |
|JavaScript| Approachability, Extensibility, Interoperability |
|Haskell   | Rigor, Expressiveness, Purity |
|Zig       | Performance, Safety, Simplicity, Robustness |



# Real-World Consequences
## And choosing the right ones




# When Values Evolve

# My Personal Values 
Personally, for me, my values are centered around performance, safety, robustness, and simplicity. Brian Cantril has a great talk on this topic. In his slide, he list out some of the core values of different programming languages.
